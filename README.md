# Biotic_disjunction


## Phylogenomics:
This includes the shell scripts to clean the sequencing data, doing the alignments, getting ASTRAL and RaxML tree
  - [1_process_then_align_subg_virgulus.sh](https://github.com/dahalsushil/biotic_disjunction/blob/main/Phylogenomics/1_process_then_align_subg_virgulus.sh): Shell script to do the alignments and get the gene trees for ASTRAL, concatenate alignments and get the concanated tree
  - [exclude_list_ASTRAL.sh](https://github.com/dahalsushil/biotic_disjunction/blob/main/Phylogenomics/exclude_list_ASTRAL.sh): This is the list to include all species within subgenus virgulus, outgroups and few species of other subgenera
  - [astral.sushilmegatree.tre](https://github.com/dahalsushil/biotic_disjunction/blob/main/Phylogenomics/Results/astral.sushilmegatree.tre): ASTRAL result
  - [subg.virgulus.raxml.support.tre](https://github.com/dahalsushil/biotic_disjunction/blob/main/Phylogenomics/Results/subg.virgulus.raxml.support.tre): RAxML result
